# Dynamic Form Generator

## Project Overview

The **Dynamic UI Generator** is a web-based application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of this project is to allow users to generate customizable forms based on a JSON structure. Users can interact with the form by adding or removing rows, with input validation included to ensure data correctness.

This project demonstrates the use of dynamic content rendering, event handling, and JSON parsing, providing a fully interactive form experience. It is designed to be a lightweight tool that can be easily extended or integrated into more complex web applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Creation**: Forms are generated from a provided JSON structure, allowing for flexibility in form design.
- **Add/Remove Rows**: Users can dynamically add or delete rows in the form, enabling a customizable experience.
- **Form Validation**: Built-in validation ensures that the required fields are properly filled out before submission.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For form generation, dynamic content rendering, and event handling.
- **HTML**: Structure of the form and page layout.
- **CSS**: Styling for the form and UI elements.
- **JSON**: Used to define the form fields and their properties dynamically.

## How It Works

1. The form is generated dynamically by parsing a JSON object that describes the fields and structure of the form.
2. Users can add or remove rows from the form by clicking corresponding buttons.
3. The form data is validated to ensure that required fields are filled in correctly.
4. The form is submitted, with the userâ€™s input processed accordingly (e.g., output to console or sent to a backend).
